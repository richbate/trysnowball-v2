      <h1>Why Snowball Works</h1>

      <p>This tool was created by someone who’s lived with debt, struggled with impulse spending, and knows the power of seeing a way out. This page explains the logic behind the app and how you can make it work for you.</p>

      <h2>What the Numbers Mean</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Debts:</strong> The full amount you owe. It’s the mountain we’re going to melt.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Paid:</strong> Money lost to lenders. Our mission is to keep this as low as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Repayments:</strong> The monthly total you’re already paying — it forms the base of your snowball.</li>
        <li><strong>Snowball:</strong> Your total repayment amount plus any extra you can afford. The bigger the snowball, the faster you knock down your debts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Smart Strategies, Not Shame</h2>
      <p>This app doesn’t tell you what to cut or guilt you into frugality. Instead, it gives you data, clarity, and structure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Track your spending.</strong> Whether you use Monzo, Snoop, or a notebook, knowing where your money goes changes everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Spot impulse patterns.</strong> Emotional spending is real — awareness is your superpower.</li>
        <li><strong>Commit to small increases.</strong> An extra £10/month could shave months off your debt journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on your why.</strong> What would it mean to be debt-free? Security, peace, freedom? Write it down.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>You’re Not Alone</h2>
      <p>This isn’t just math — it’s momentum. Every pound you throw at your snowball brings you closer to being free. You’ve got this.</p>

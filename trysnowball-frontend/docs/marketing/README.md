# üéØ Marketing Consultant Onboarding Pack

**Welcome! This pack gets you up to speed on TrySnowball quickly and safely.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT access `.data` on any manager.** Always use the async facade (e.g., `debtsManager.getData()` / `getMetrics()`). Direct `.data` access will crash in production and is blocked by ESLint, dev proxy guard, and CI.

## ‚ùì Common FAQs

### **"Is this just another budgeting app?"**
No - TrySnowball focuses specifically on debt elimination strategy. You don't need to track every expense, just input your debts and see your payoff plan.

### **"Why pay smallest debt first instead of highest interest?"**
The snowball method prioritizes psychological wins. Eliminating a debt completely feels amazing and keeps you motivated. For many people, this emotional boost leads to better long-term success than the mathematically optimal avalanche method.

### **"Is my data secure?"**
Absolutely. Your debt information is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB. We don't send your personal financial data to our servers.

### **"What's the difference between Free and Pro?"**
Free gives you everything needed for basic debt elimination planning. Pro adds advanced analytics, AI coaching, export functionality, and priority support for ¬£9.99/month.

### **"Can I use this for US debts?"**
While designed for UK users, the debt snowball method works anywhere. You can manually enter any currency - just select the US demo data to see dollar examples.

### **"How accurate are the calculations?"**
Very accurate. We use compound interest calculations with the exact same formulas your lenders use. The projections assume you make payments on time and don't add new debt.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes for Demos

### **Safe Patterns for Demo Setup**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Always use these patterns in demos
const { debts, metrics, loading } = useDebts();
const { settings } = useSettings();

// ‚ùå Never access these during demos  
// debtsManager.data.debts  // Will crash
// localStorage.getItem()   // Use hooks instead
```

### **Demo Data Reset**
```javascript
// Clear demo data if needed
const { clearAllData, refresh } = useDebts();
await clearAllData();
await refresh();
```

### **Common Demo Issues**
- **Empty state**: Always load demo data first
- **Loading states**: Wait for data to fully load before screenshoting
- **Mobile responsive**: Test on actual mobile device for screenshots

# INCIDENT REPORT: Missing Production API Worker

**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Complete debt sync failure, silent data loss risk  

## Timeline

- **Sep 8, 13:22-18:36**: Multiple successful debts API deployments
- **Sep 9, ~13:50**: User reports no debt sync after login
- **Sep 9, 13:59**: Discovery that `trysnowball-debts-api-prod` worker missing from account
- **Sep 9, 14:00**: Emergency redeployment successful

## Root Cause
**UNKNOWN** - Production Cloudflare Worker vanished overnight with no audit trail

## Impact
- Users could add debts via UI but they wouldn't sync to D1
- Silent failure - no error messages to users
- Data appeared to save locally but was lost on page refresh
- Complete breakdown of cloud sync functionality

## Immediate Actions Taken
‚úÖ Emergency redeployment of debts API worker  
‚úÖ Verified API endpoints responding correctly  
‚úÖ Confirmed D1 database connectivity  

## Critical Gaps Identified
‚ùå **No monitoring/alerting for worker health**  
‚ùå **No automated deployment verification**  
‚ùå **No audit trail for worker deletion events**  
‚ùå **Silent failure mode - users not notified of sync issues**

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Health Check Monitoring**
   - Add `/health` endpoint to all production workers
   - Set up external monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
   - Alert on API 404/500 responses

2. **Client-Side Error Handling**  
   - Show user notification when API calls fail
   - Add "Offline Mode" banner when backend unreachable
   - Log `backend_unreachable` PostHog events

3. **Deployment Verification**
   - Add automated post-deploy health checks
   - Verify all routes are responding after deployment

### Short Term (This Month)
1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Move to Terraform/Pulumi for worker management
   - Version-controlled infrastructure configuration

2. **Redundancy**
   - Consider backup worker deployments
   - Database replication monitoring

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Enable Cloudflare audit logs
   - Track all worker create/delete operations

## Risk Assessment
- **HIGH**: This could happen again without warning
- **HIGH**: Silent failures are worst type of production issue
- **MEDIUM**: User data integrity at risk during outage windows

## Status
üî¥ **UNRESOLVED** - Root cause unknown, monitoring gaps remain  
üü¢ **SERVICE RESTORED** - API worker redeployed and functional

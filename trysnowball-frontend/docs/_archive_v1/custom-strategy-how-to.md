# Build a Custom Payoff Strategy (mix and match)

Not every debt fits a neat formula. Create a plan you can actually sustain.

## Step 1 — Define non‑negotiables
- Stay current on all minimums  
- Keep a £500–£1,000 buffer  
- Avoid new debt during the sprint

## Step 2 — Pick a base
Start **Snowball** (for motivation) or **Avalanche** (for interest). It's your baseline.

## Step 3 — Add overrides
- If a card's promo rate is ending soon → bump it up the queue  
- If a tiny balance keeps nagging you → finish it early  
- If a lender is toxic to deal with → prioritise for peace of mind

## Step 4 — Review monthly
Adjust based on what *actually* happened—income spikes, surprise bills, or a cleared debt releasing momentum.

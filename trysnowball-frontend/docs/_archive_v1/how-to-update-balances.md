# How to Update Balances Quickly (and correctly)

Small process, big impact.

1. **Pick one day** a month. Same date, every time.  
2. **Record balances first**, then payments. Avoid "back‑solving" from statements.  
3. **Note the APR** and **minimums**—changes here shift payoff dates.  
4. **Track interest** separately if you can. It shows real progress even in slow months.  
5. **Celebrate a clear**. When a balance hits 0, move its payment to the next debt immediately (that's your snowball).

> If you miss a month, don't backfill the past—just resume on the next chosen date.

# CP-5: Goals Engine (Planned)

**Status**: ðŸ•“ Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2024-09-11  
**Affects**: Future feature development

## Purpose

Placeholder documentation for the next major system component: user-defined financial goals and milestone tracking beyond basic debt payoff.

## Planned Capabilities

### Goal Types
- **Debt-Free Target Date**: "I want to be debt-free by December 2025"
- **Payment Budget Goals**: "I can afford $500/month total debt payments"
- **Interest Savings Goals**: "I want to save at least $2000 in interest charges"
- **Emergency Fund Integration**: "Build $1000 emergency fund before aggressive debt payoff"

### Goal-Driven Simulations
- Reverse-calculate required payments to meet target dates
- Optimize payment allocation to minimize total interest within constraints
- Balance multiple competing financial priorities

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress indicators toward goals
- Milestone celebration (first debt paid off, halfway to debt-free, etc.)
- Adjustment recommendations when off-track

## System Integration Points

### With Forecast Engine V2 (CP-4)
- Goals engine provides constraints and targets
- Forecast engine calculates scenarios to meet goals
- Iterative optimization to find best payment strategy

### With Clean Debt Model (CP-1)
- Goal progress tracked against actual debt balances
- Goal recalculation when debts are updated
- Historical progress preservation

## Architectural Considerations

### Data Storage
```typescript
interface UserGoal {
  id: string
  type: 'debt_free_date' | 'payment_budget' | 'interest_savings'
  target: number | Date
  current_progress: number
  created_at: Date
  target_date?: Date
  priority: number
}
```

### Calculation Engine
- Goal feasibility analysis
- Payment optimization algorithms
- Progress projection and timeline updates

## Technical Challenges

1. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balancing competing goals (speed vs. cost)
2. **User Behavior Modeling**: Accounting for realistic payment consistency
3. **Goal Conflict Resolution**: What happens when goals are mathematically impossible
4. **Performance**: Real-time goal recalculation as debts change

## User Experience Considerations

### Goal Setup Flow
- Simple goal wizard for common scenarios
- Advanced mode for complex multi-goal setups
- Reality-check feedback ("This goal would require $2000/month payments")

### Progress Visualization
- Goal progress dashboards
- Timeline showing goal achievement dates
- Celebration of milestone completions

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- **Income-Based Goals**: Link to salary/income projections
- **Life Event Integration**: Account for major purchases, job changes
- **Goal Sharing**: Social features for accountability
- **AI Goal Coaching**: Personalized recommendations and strategy adjustments

## Development Priority

This component is planned for implementation after:
1. âœ… CP-1: Clean Debt Model (Complete)
2. âœ… CP-3: Bucket System (Complete)  
3. âœ… CP-4: Forecast Engine V2 (Complete)
4. ðŸ•“ CP-5: Goals Engine (This document)

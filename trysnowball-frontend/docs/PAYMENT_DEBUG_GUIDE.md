## What This Reveals

### ✅ If You See a Difference:
- The math is working correctly
- UI might not be updating properly
- Chart resolution might be hiding small differences

### ❌ If You See NO Difference:
- Data structure mismatch (debt amounts don't match expectations)
- Interest rates might be wrong
- Minimum payments calculated incorrectly
- Logic error in simulation

## Advanced Debugging

### Check Your Actual Debt Data
```javascript
// See exactly what debt data is being used
console.log('Current debts:', debtsManager.getDebts());

// Compare with expected £35,698 total
const total = debtsManager.getDebts().reduce((sum, debt) => 
  sum + (debt.balance || debt.amount || 0), 0);
console.log('Actual total:', total);  // Should be ~£35,698
```

### Verify Interest Rates
```javascript
// Check if all debts have proper interest rates
debtsManager.getDebts().forEach(debt => {
  console.log(`${debt.name}: ${debt.rate || debt.interest || 'NO RATE SET'}% APR`);
});
```

### Test Custom Amounts
```javascript
// Test with your specific £35,698 scenario
debtsManager.analyzePayments(1941, 2191, 60);

// Test extreme difference to verify it's working
debtsManager.analyzePayments(1500, 3000, 60); // Should show BIG difference
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No debts found for analysis"
**Solution:** Your debt data isn't loaded. Try:
1. Navigate to `/debts` page first
2. Add some debts
3. Then run the analysis

### Issue: Both scenarios show same timeline
**Possible causes:**
1. **Extra payment too small**: £250 difference might not matter much for large debt
2. **Interest rates too low**: If rates are 0%, extra payments matter less
3. **Minimum payments too high**: If minimums are already paying down debt fast

### Issue: Results don't match UI
**Possible causes:**
1. **Demo data vs real data**: UI might be using different debt amounts
2. **Caching issues**: React state might not be updating
3. **Chart resolution**: 61-month limit might hide differences

## Quick Fixes to Test

### Force UI Update
```javascript
// Trigger a manual calculation refresh
window.location.reload();  // Simple but effective
```

### Compare with Baseline Demo Data
```javascript
// The demo data totals £43,905, not £35,698
// If your analysis shows £43,905, that's why the UI doesn't match
```

## Expected Results for £35,698

If you have **actual debt of £35,698**:
- **£1941/month**: Should pay off in ~22-24 months
- **£2191/month**: Should pay off in ~19-21 months  
- **Difference**: 3-5 months faster

If you see **no difference**, there's definitely a bug to fix!

## Export Data for Further Analysis

```javascript
// Get full payment timeline data
const analysis = debtsManager.analyzePayments(1941, 2191);

// Export to examine in spreadsheet
console.log('Raw timeline data:', analysis.monthlyBalances);

// Export debt history for verification
console.log('Debt history:', debtsManager.exportDebtHistory());
```

This debugging function will instantly reveal why the payment change isn't affecting your timeline! 🎯

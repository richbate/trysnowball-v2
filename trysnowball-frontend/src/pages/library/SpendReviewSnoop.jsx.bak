   <Article title="Tesco Is My Second Home — A Year of Spending, According to Snoop" description="What a spend review reveals — and how to turn it into faster debt payoff.">
    <p>Snoop just crunched my bank data, and I'm equal parts fascinated and mildly concerned.</p>
    <p>Nearly half of my tracked spending — <strong>43%</strong> — went to Tesco. That's not "a lot of grocery shopping," that's "Tesco might start charging me rent."</p>
    <p><strong>B&Q</strong> has quietly become my weekend habit. I've spent £1,687 there this year — enough for the staff to start recognising me, and for me to know exactly which aisle the good timber's on.</p>
    <p>Then there's <strong>TK Maxx</strong>. £1,308 gone, mostly on clothes. Which, for the record, is more than I've spent on petrol this year. My wardrobe is now 80% "last season's bargains" and I regret none of it.</p>
    <h3>Other big hitters</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Amazon: £2,121 — every box a mystery until opened</li>
     <li>IKEA: £932 — flat‑pack is my siren song</li>
     <li>Trainline: £980 — the cost of leaving the house</li>
     <li>Five Guys: £153 — that's a lot of burgers</li>
     <li>Wagamama: £150 — the price of all that katsu</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What it tells me</h3>
    <p>I'm not a little‑and‑often spender. I stockpile cash, then splurge hard on the things I love (or think I'll love when I click "buy").</p>
    <h3>Turn it into progress</h3>
    <p>Debt isn't just about what you owe — it's about where your money <em>leaks</em>. A spend review is a mirror. Tools like Snoop help, but pairing it with a TrySnowball plan lets you re‑route even 10–15% of those top categories into smashing balances.</p>

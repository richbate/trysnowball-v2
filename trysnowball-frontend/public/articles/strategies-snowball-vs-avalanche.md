# Debt Strategies: Snowball vs Avalanche (and when to use each)

**TL;DR**  
- **Snowball**: smallest balance first → faster *wins*, better motivation.  
- **Avalanche**: highest APR first → lower total interest, sometimes longer until first win.  
- **Custom**: blend the two when your situation demands it.

## When to pick Snowball
If you've started and stopped before, momentum matters more than pure math. Clearing a small debt in 2–3 months can lock the habit in.

## When to pick Avalanche
If you carry a large high‑APR card, the interest drag is real. Put extra there *after* you've covered all minimums.

## A pragmatic approach
Start **Snowball** for 3 months to build the habit, then re‑evaluate. If interest costs dominate, switch to **Avalanche** for your top APR card.

> Tip: Don't churn methods every week. Set a rule for when you switch (e.g., after the first two debts are cleared).

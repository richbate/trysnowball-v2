Car finance. The usual suspects.</p><p>0% offers came and went, some cards were paid off, nice things were bought. </p><p>It’s not catastrophic, but it’s enough to weigh me down. It’s enough to make my future feel… smaller and to limit my options. </p><h3><strong>Why write this? Why now?</strong></h3><p>Because <strong>debt thrives on silence.</strong> On shame. On “I’ll sort it next month.”</p><p>I’ve spent years thinking:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Once I get through this busy patch, I’ll fix it.”</em></p><p><em>“Once I get that pay rise, I’ll fix it.”</em></p><p><em>“Once the house sells, I’ll fix it.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the debt stayed. Or it crept up. Or I made a dent, then backslid.</p><p>I’ve had enough.</p><h3><strong>The tool I’m building to help myself (and maybe you)</strong></h3><p>I’ve been building a tool called <strong><a href=\"https://trysnowball.co.uk/\">TrySnowball</a></strong>. It’s a debt repayment <s>app </s> system based on the proven snowball method by Dave Ramsey (he’s a bit of a money hero)  - small wins first, momentum builds, freedom follows.</p><p>I’ve used all the things. <a href=\"https://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html\">Vertex’s snowball</a> planner was the best, but even that felt too clunky. too onerous, too static, too optimistic even. </p><p>But tools alone don’t fix behaviour.</p><p>So I’m going to eat my own dog food, be my own user.</p><p>And I’m going to document the whole thing here, honestly.</p><p><strong>The spreadsheets | The scary graphs | The spending slip-ups | The wins </strong></p><p>No matter how small.</p><p>Here’s how things look today. Bleak right? Even after 5 years of payments, I’ll still be in debt. </p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zVJs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2668ebea-3565-4bbe-bea8-ba959375a908_1736x822.png\"><div><picture></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps\">Dave Ramsey’s 7 Baby Steps</a> seem like the best model.

Wait 24 hours. This gives your brain time to cool off and decide if the item is really worth it.</p><h4><strong>Make a List — and Stick to It:</strong></h4><p>Whether you’re heading to the shops or browsing online, always go in with a list. It helps you stay focused and avoid falling for distractions or flashy deals.</p><h4><strong>Avoid Tempting Spaces:</strong></h4><p>If emails, apps or ads are your weak spots, do a digital detox.</p><p>If you need it, sure — get it. But don’t treat a 40% off sale as an excuse to get deeper into debt.</p><h2><strong>Why I Built Try Snowball (And How It Helps Here):</strong></h2><p>If you’re tempted to spend, or wondering how that “bargain” might actually cost you long-term, Try Snowball can help you see the bigger picture.</p><p>It shows you how every extra purchase - big or small - can shift your debt-free date, increase the interest you’ll pay, and slow down your progress. Sometimes it’s not about the <span class=\"money-amount\">£40</span> saved on a sale. It’s about how much longer you’re carrying that debt because of it.</p><p>Try it out. See how those spending decisions really play out.</p><p>It might make that sale a lot less tempting.</p>"

My friend asked if I’d buy him some trainers on my card and he’d give me the money so I could waste it on hair clips and sweets.</p><p>So there it started. Living beyond my means, using money that wasn’t real but would somehow haunt me and hold me back for the rest of my life.</p><p>Over the years, I’ve got better at managing it. I’ve read the books, tried the apps, done the spreadsheets, had the sleepless nights, made the big repayments, watched the balances creep back up again. I’ve told myself it’s under control. I’ve told myself it’s not as bad as it used to be. I’ve told myself I’m too smart to fall for it again.</p><p>And yet… here we are.</p><p>Try Snowball isn’t about pretending I’ve figured it all out. It’s about building the tool I needed years ago. Something simple, visual, honest. Something that shows you the progress you <em>can</em> make, even if you’ve made mistakes before. Something that doesn’t make you feel ashamed, just gives you a plan and a bit of encouragement to stick to it.</p><p>Most apps out there are built for people who already have their finances sorted. They want you to upload all your bank accounts, create perfect budgets, track every penny. That’s great — but it’s not where I’m at. And I know I’m not the only one.</p><p>Sometimes you just need something small, something clear. A snowball rolling in the right direction.</p><p>That’s what I’m trying to build. And if you’re reading this, maybe it’s something you need too.</p><p>You can add your debts, see a timeline of how these reduce over time, upload transactions to see where you could make savings and there’s a magic button that makes them all disappear in half the time</p><p>This is early stage development, I think it can be a real thing. I’d love to know what you think, suggest features, tell me it’s awful. All feedback is welcome</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GBcN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafe3b492-ed3f-4e8b-bed1-79fa4afb41ef_1758x1686.png\"><div><picture></picture></div></a></figure></div>"

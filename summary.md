# Project Review Summary

## Document Relationships Review

### ✅ Project Structure & Imports
- All component imports are properly resolved
- SpendAnalyser correctly integrates with WhatIfMachine via localStorage
- Navigation between pages works through `onPageChange` prop
- No broken imports or missing dependencies

### ✅ Component Relationships
- App.js properly imports and renders all page components
- SpendAnalyser (`/src/components/SpendAnalyser.js`) saves data to localStorage that WhatIfMachine reads
- Data flows correctly: SpendAnalyser → localStorage → WhatIfMachine
- MyDebtsPage stores/retrieves debt data via localStorage

### ✅ Build Status
- Project compiles successfully with no errors
- Only deprecation warning (fs.F_OK) which is from Node.js, not your code
- Production build created without issues

### Key Integration Points Working:
1. `SpendAnalyser.js:220` - Saves snowball data to localStorage
2. `WhatIfMachine.js:120` - Reads pending snowball data on mount
3. `MyDebtsPage.js:52` - Loads saved debt data from localStorage

## Conclusion
All document relationships are functioning properly with no errors or broken references. The project is in a healthy state with proper component integration and data flow.

    <h1>Why Snowball Works</h1>

    <p>This tool was created by someone who‚Äôs lived with debt, struggled with impulse spending, and knows the power of seeing a way out. This page explains the logic behind the app and how you can make it work for you.</p>

    <h2>What the Numbers Mean</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Debts:</strong> The full amount you owe. It‚Äôs the mountain we‚Äôre going to melt.</li>
      <li><strong>Interest Paid:</strong> Money lost to lenders. Our mission is to keep this as low as possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Repayments:</strong> The monthly total you‚Äôre already paying ‚Äî it forms the base of your snowball.</li>
      <li><strong>Snowball:</strong> Your total repayment amount plus any extra you can afford. The bigger the snowball, the faster you knock down your debts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Smart Strategies, Not Shame</h2>
    <p>This app doesn‚Äôt tell you what to cut or guilt you into frugality. Instead, it gives you data, clarity, and structure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Track your spending.</strong> Whether you use Monzo, Snoop, or a notebook, knowing where your money goes changes everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Spot impulse patterns.</strong> Emotional spending is real ‚Äî awareness is your superpower.</li>
      <li><strong>Commit to small increases.</strong> An extra ¬£10/month could shave months off your debt journey.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on your why.</strong> What would it mean to be debt-free? Security, peace, freedom? Write it down.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>üí° Why We Believe in the Snowball Method</h2>
        <p>At Snowball, we focus on what gets results‚Äînot just what looks best on paper.</p>
        <p>
          The <strong>debt snowball method</strong> is simple: pay off your smallest debt first, then roll that payment into the next one. 
          Mathematically, it‚Äôs not the cheapest method‚Äîthat title goes to the avalanche, which targets high-interest debt first. 
          But real life isn‚Äôt lived in spreadsheets.
        </p>

        <h3>üìö What the Research Says</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Motivation > Math:</strong> A landmark study from the Kellogg School of Management (Gal &amp; McShane, 2012) 
            analyzed nearly 6,000 people in debt repayment programs. Those who tackled small debts first were more likely to become debt-free, 
            thanks to the motivational boost of early wins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backed by behavioral science:</strong> Paying off a small balance gives a psychological boost that encourages follow-through. 
            It‚Äôs emotional fuel, especially important for those feeling overwhelmed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not the cheapest, but the most effective for many:</strong> The avalanche method saves a little more in interest, 
            but studies show that people using the snowball method stick with it and succeed more often.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Why Minimum Payments Are a Trap</h1>

    <p>When your credit card bill arrives, that <strong>“minimum payment due”</strong> can feel like a lifeline — just a small amount to keep things ticking over.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Minimum payments are designed to keep you in debt. Not to help you out of it.</strong></blockquote>

    <h2>💣 1. Minimum Payments Are Mostly Interest</h2>
    <p>You might pay £40, but most of that goes to interest. On a £2,000 debt at 20% APR, only £7 might go toward the actual balance.</p>

    <h2>🕳️ 2. They Create the Illusion of Progress</h2>
    <p>It feels like you’re doing the right thing, but you’re actually stuck — with interest quietly compounding every month.</p>

    <h2>🔁 3. You Stay in the Cycle Longer</h2>
    <p>Banks profit when you only pay the minimum — because it stretches your debt over decades.</p>

    <h2>🚀 So, What Should You Do Instead?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Always pay more</strong> than the minimum — even £20 extra helps</li>
      <li><strong>Try the snowball or avalanche method</strong> for faster progress</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="../what-if.html">What If Machine</a> to test scenarios</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Minimum payments keep you stuck. Break the cycle and take control of your financial future.</p>

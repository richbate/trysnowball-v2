    <h1>Where Does It All Go? The Truth About Your Monthly Spending Habits</h1>

    <p>Ever get to the end of the month and wonder where your money went? You're not alone. Most of us underestimate how much we spend on everyday items — and how those small, unconscious expenses add up over time. Let's break down the truth about monthly spending habits and how to take control of yours.</p>

    <h2>Unconscious Spending Adds Up</h2>
    <p>Whether it’s £3 on coffee, £12 on takeaway delivery fees, or £30 on subscription services you’ve forgotten about — these costs often fly under the radar. When untracked, they become the biggest leaks in your budget.</p>

    <h2>The Latte Isn’t the Enemy — Habits Are</h2>
    <p>It’s not about guilt-tripping yourself for small indulgences. It’s about being intentional. Regular small expenses are fine if you value them and can afford them. But when they replace savings, debt repayment, or essential needs, they become harmful habits.</p>

    <h2>Tracking Your Spending Creates Awareness</h2>
    <p>Start by tracking everything you spend for just one month. Use a spreadsheet, an app, or even pen and paper. Categorise by type: needs, wants, and waste. You’ll be surprised how quickly patterns emerge.</p>

    <h2>Common Spending Black Holes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Takeaways and delivery fees</li>
      <li>Streaming services you barely watch</li>
      <li>Impulse buys — especially online</li>
      <li>Interest on credit cards from unnecessary purchases</li>
      <li>Overpriced convenience items</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Create a Spending Plan (Not a Budget)</h2>
    <p>Think of it as giving every pound a job. Prioritise essentials, savings, and debt payments first. Then choose what luxuries are worth keeping. This empowers you to spend with purpose, not regret.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to eliminate joy from your life to get your finances under control. But you do need to know where your money goes. Awareness is the first step toward freedom.</p>

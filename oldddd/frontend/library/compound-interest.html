    <h1>The Hidden Danger of Compound Interest When You're in Debt</h1>

    <p>When people hear "compound interest," they often think of it as a powerful tool for building wealth. And it is — if you're saving or investing.</p>

    <p>But when you’re in debt, compound interest works against you — quietly, relentlessly, and often without you realising the full cost.</p>

    <h2>1. Interest on Interest — That’s the Problem</h2>
    <p>Unlike simple interest, which only applies to your original balance, compound interest builds on itself. If you don’t pay off the full balance, the unpaid interest is added to your total, and next month’s interest is calculated on that higher amount.</p>
    <p>Over time, this snowballs — your debt grows not because you're spending more, but because you're not keeping up with the interest.</p>

    <h2>2. Minimum Payments Don’t Touch It</h2>
    <p>If you're only making the minimum payment on a credit card or loan, a large chunk (or all) of that payment goes toward interest. This means you're not reducing the actual debt, and the compounding continues month after month.</p>
    <p>What looks like manageable debt on paper becomes years of repayment in practice.</p>

    <h2>3. The True Cost is Hidden</h2>
    <p>Compound interest makes it difficult to understand what you really owe. A £5,000 balance at 20% APR might cost over £10,000 in total repayments if paid slowly.</p>
    <p>Most people don’t realise this until it’s too late — and by then, they’ve paid thousands in extra interest.</p>

    <h2>4. It Rewards the Lender — Not You</h2>
    <p>Compound interest is great for banks. It’s what allows them to earn steady profits from people who stay in debt.</p>
    <p>But for you, the borrower, it means you're paying significantly more than you originally borrowed — simply for the privilege of borrowing it in the first place.</p>

    <h2>5. How to Break the Cycle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay more than the minimum — even a small extra payment each month cuts down compounding.</li>
      <li>Use methods like the <strong>Snowball</strong> or <strong>Avalanche</strong> approach to prioritise and reduce debts.</li>
      <li>Explore our <a href="../what-if.html">What If Machine</a> to see how small changes can drastically reduce your payoff time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Compound interest is a silent force — when you're saving, it's your best friend. But in debt? It's your worst enemy. The sooner you understand how it works, the faster you can take steps to protect yourself from its hidden cost.</p>

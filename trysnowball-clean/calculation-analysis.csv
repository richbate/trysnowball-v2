=== Summary Comparison ===
Metric,My_b1,My_b2,My_b3,Expected_b1,Expected_b2,Expected_b3,Total_Mine,Total_Expected
Payment,116.67,33.33,50,111.63,69.08,19.29,200.00,200.00
Principal,105.05,14.25,50,100,50,19.29,169.30,169.29
Balance,394.95,985.75,1450,400,950,1480.71,2830.70,2830.71

=== Key Differences ===
- My proportional shares: 16.67, 33.33, 50.00
- But fixture shows very different payment distribution
- b2 gets 69.08 payment (vs my 33.33) - that's +35.75
- b3 gets 19.29 payment (vs my 50.00) - that's -30.71
- The difference (35.75 - 30.71 = 5.04) roughly matches b1's overage
- This suggests the fixture uses a DIFFERENT algorithm than proportional allocation

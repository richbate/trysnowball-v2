# üõë CP-5 Blocking PR Checklist ‚Äî Goals & Challenges Layer

**Status**: BLOCKING | **Version**: v1.0 | **Merge Policy**: ALL ITEMS REQUIRED

This PR must not be merged until **all items are complete, tested, documented, and verified**.  
Goal: Deliver a bulletproof Goals & Challenges engine with schema accuracy, entitlement discipline, golden test coverage, analytics integrity, and full documentation alignment.

---

## üìã 1. Schema & Validation
- [ ] `Goal` interface implemented exactly as defined in CP-5_GOALS_ENGINE.md
- [ ] ENUMs (`GoalType`, `GoalStatus`) locked and type-checked
- [ ] Validation rules enforced:
  - `target_value > 0`
  - `target_date > start_date`
  - Only one active `DEBT_CLEAR` goal per debt/bucket
  - Status transitions limited to `ACTIVE ‚Üí [ACHIEVED | FAILED | CANCELLED]`
- [ ] Entitlement checks (`goals.max_active`, `goals.allowed_types`) enforced before creation

---

## üß™ 2. Golden Test Scenarios
- [ ] All 9 golden scenarios from `cp5-goals.fixtures.json` implemented and passing:
  - Debt Clear Goal ‚Äî success + failure
  - Amount Paid Goal ‚Äî progression + achievement
  - Interest Saved Goal
  - Timebound Goal
  - Goal Cancellation
  - Goal Editing
  - Challenge Assignment
  - Entitlement Blocks (max_active + allowed_types)
- [ ] Tests validate:
  - State transitions
  - Analytics payloads (exact match, no fuzzy)
  - Currency rounding (2dp), APR rounding (1dp)
  - ENUMs from locked vocabulary
  - Required fields: `user_id`, `forecast_version`
- [ ] Fixture coverage test ensures no scenario silently dropped

---

## üìä 3. Analytics Events
- [ ] All 7 events implemented exactly as defined in CP-5_ANALYTICS_SUITE.md:
  - `goal_created`
  - `goal_updated`
  - `goal_progressed`
  - `goal_achieved`
  - `goal_failed`
  - `challenge_assigned`
  - `entitlement_blocked`
- [ ] Payloads match schema:
  - `user_id`, `goal_id`, `goal_type`, `forecast_version` required
  - Currency rounded to 2dp, APR to 1dp
  - ENUMs enforced, no free-text
- [ ] PostHog dev project verification complete:
  - Each event visible with correct payloads
  - Error codes ENUMed (`ENTITLEMENT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `INVALID_DATE_RANGE`, etc.)
- [ ] Volume controls in place:
  - `goal_progressed` batched, no spam
  - Deduplication of repeated events

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Entitlement Model
- [ ] `Entitlement` interface implemented exactly as defined in ENTITLEMENTS.md
- [ ] Default config loaded (Free vs Pro split):
  - Free: `max_active = 1`, `allowed_types = ["DEBT_CLEAR"]`
  - Pro: `max_active = 10`, `allowed_types = ["DEBT_CLEAR","AMOUNT_PAID","INTEREST_SAVED","TIMEBOUND"]`
- [ ] `entitlement_blocked` event fires on violation
- [ ] Unit tests in `ENTITLEMENTS.test.ts` confirm config matches fixture expectations
- [ ] Any entitlement drift fails tests automatically

---

## üéØ 5. User Flows & UI Integration
- [ ] Flows in CP-5_USER_FLOWS.md implemented:
  - Goal Creation
  - Progress Tracking
  - Goal Achievement
  - Entitlement Block & Upgrade
- [ ] **Cancellation Flow** added:
  - User cancels goal ‚Üí status `CANCELLED`
  - Fires `goal_updated`
  - Goal archived in UI
- [ ] **Editing Flow** added:
  - User edits goal ‚Üí target updated
  - Fires `goal_updated`
  - UI shows new target
- [ ] **Challenge Assignment Flow** added:
  - System suggests challenge ‚Üí user accepts/rejects
  - Fires `challenge_assigned`
- [ ] UI Components implemented:
  - GoalsPage, GoalCard, EntitlementGate
  - GoalCard supports ACTIVE, ACHIEVED, FAILED, CANCELLED
  - UpgradePrompt shown on entitlement block
- [ ] Analytics events fire correctly during all UI flows

---

## üß™ 6. End-to-End Tests (Staging Verification)
- [ ] Cypress (or equivalent) tests cover:
  - Create goal ‚Üí GoalCard visible ‚Üí `goal_created` event fires
  - Progress goal ‚Üí `goal_progressed` fires with updated value
  - Cancel goal ‚Üí status = CANCELLED ‚Üí `goal_updated` event
  - Edit goal ‚Üí target updated ‚Üí `goal_updated` event
  - Challenge assigned ‚Üí GoalCard created ‚Üí `challenge_assigned` event
  - Free user blocked ‚Üí `entitlement_blocked` event + upgrade prompt
- [ ] Tests run in staging with real PostHog dev connection
- [ ] Screenshots/logs attached to PR for reviewer validation

---

  - Goal cancellation and editing flows
  - Challenge assignment golden test scenario
  - Integration points for cancellation/editing
- [ ] **CP-5_ANALYTICS_SUITE.md** updated with:

- ✅ **Live Forecast Graph** - SVG line chart comparing min payments vs snowball
- ✅ **Interactive Snowball Slider** - Real-time adjustment with notches at key values
- ✅ **Collapsed Details** - Monthly breakdown hidden by default for better UX

### **3. What's Working vs What's Not**
#### ✅ **Production Ready**
- Core debt management (add/edit/delete)
- Basic forecast calculations
- Profile switching (data wiped each session)
- UK currency formatting
- Responsive UI components
- Goals & Challenges UI (CP-5)

#### ⚠️ **Partially Working** 
- **CP-4 Multi-APR Engine**: 8/12 golden tests passing (67% success rate)
- **Analytics Events**: Defined but not connected to PostHog yet
- **Advanced Forecasting**: Complex edge cases still have calculation bugs

#### ❌ **Known Limitations**
- No data persistence (intentional for testing)
- TypeScript errors in analytics layers (non-blocking)
- 4 complex CP-4 test scenarios still failing
- Multi-debt snowball timing edge cases

---

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Basic Debt Management**
1. Start with "Clean Slate" profile
2. Add a new debt manually
3. Switch to "Single Credit Card" profile
4. Observe data replacement and calculations

### **Scenario 2: Family Debt Portfolio**
1. Load "Family Debt Load" profile
2. Navigate to "Freedom Plan" tab
3. Check forecast calculations
4. Switch to "Goals & Challenges" tab

### **Scenario 3: CP-4 Multi-APR Engine + Interactive Features** 
1. Load "Multi-APR CP-4 Demo" profile
2. **Test Interactive Slider**: Drag snowball amount from £200 to £500
3. **Observe Real-time Updates**: Watch graph and summary cards update instantly
4. **Analyze Forecast Graph**: Compare green line (snowball) vs red dashed line (minimum payments)
5. **Optional Detail Dive**: Click "Show Month-by-Month Breakdown" button
6. Navigate through months 1-10 using dropdown
7. Observe bucket-by-bucket payment allocation (Cash Advances → Purchases → Balance Transfer)

### **Scenario 4: Interactive Slider & Graph Testing**
1. Load "Family Debt Load" profile (£320k+ total debt - great for seeing dramatic changes)
2. **Slider Testing**: 
   - Start with £200 snowball, note freedom date in graph
   - Drag slider to £500, watch green line shift dramatically left
   - Try extreme values: £0 (slider left) vs £1000 (slider right)
   - Notice visual notches at £50, £100, £200, £250, £500 marks
3. **Graph Analysis**: 
   - Red dashed line = minimum payments only (slower payoff)
   - Green solid line = with snowball (faster payoff)
   - Y-axis shows debt balance decreasing over time
   - X-axis shows months to freedom

### **Scenario 5: Almost Debt Free Journey**
1. Load "Almost Debt Free" profile
2. See how small balance affects calculations with slider at different values
3. Check goals progress simulation

## 🔍 **What You'll See in the Interface**

### **Main Navigation**
- **My Debts** - Standard debt management
- **Freedom Plan** - Forecast and payoff strategy  
- **Goals & Challenges** - CP-5 goals system
- **🛠️ Debug Showcase** - **← Your testing environment**

### **Debug Showcase Features**
1. **Profile Selector** - 6 different debt scenarios
2. **Live Status** - Current debt count, total balance, min payments
3. **Calculation Engine** - Average APR, monthly interest, freedom date
4. **UK Debt Types Display** - Formatted debt breakdown
5. **Analytics Events** - Mock event tracking display
6. **Raw Data Dump** - JSON inspection of all calculations

---

## 🎯 **Key Success Metrics**

### **What Works Well** ✅
- Profile switching is instant and data clears properly
- Calculations update in real-time as you change profiles
- UI is responsive and shows all debt types correctly
- Debug information is comprehensive and useful
- No data persistence issues (intentional design)

### **What to Focus Testing On** 🎯
- **Data Handling**: Switch between profiles rapidly
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Check if numbers make sense
- **UI Responsiveness**: All tabs and features accessible
- **Edge Cases**: Try "Almost Debt Free" and "High Earner" scenarios
- **Debug Tools**: Use raw data dump to inspect calculations

---

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **No Local Storage**: All data is wiped when you refresh or close
2. **Profile Loading**: Takes 1-2 seconds due to API simulation
3. **TypeScript Warnings**: Present but non-blocking (analytics layer issues)
4. **CP-4 Limitations**: 4 complex test cases still failing (documented in golden tests)
5. **Mock Backend**: Using React Query with simulated server responses

---

## 📋 **Next Steps Based on Your Testing**

After you test the interface, we can:

1. **Fix Priority Issues** - Address any blocking problems you find
2. **Complete Analytics** - Connect PostHog events to live data
3. **Resolve CP-4 Edge Cases** - Fix the remaining 4 test failures
4. **Add Production Polish** - Performance, error handling, documentation
5. **Deployment Preparation** - Make it production-ready
